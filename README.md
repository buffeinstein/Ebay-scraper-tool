This code allows you to scrape ebay to find the following information about an item: 
1) name 
2) price
3) shipping cost
4) free returns
5) items sold
6) owned status 

written according to the directions here: https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_03



Running the python code ebay-dl2.py allows you to enter in three arguments, as the code uses the argparse library. 

the arguments allow you to edit: 
1) what item you want to search for. make sure to put quotes around your item if the search has a space in it. EX: 'leather jacket women'. 
2) (optional argument, default set to 10 )enter in how many pages of ebay you want it to scrape with: --page_number = 
3) (optional argument, default set to json) enter in --csv if you want it saved as a csv file 

Here are the 6 commands I ran, the first three create json files, the next three create csv files, and all of them scrape 10 images 


how to run your ebay-dl.py file, using markdown code block(s) (and not inline code annotations) to show the exact commands that should be run to generate the 3 json files in your repo
