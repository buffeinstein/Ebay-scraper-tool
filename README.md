This code allows you to scrape ebay to find the following information about an item: 
1) name 
2) price
3) shipping cost
4) free returns
5) items sold
6) owned status 


Running the python code ebay-dl2.py allows you to enter in three arguments, as the code uses the argparse library. 

the arguments allow you to edit: 
1) what item you want to search for. make sure to put quotes around your item if the search has a space in it. EX: 'leather jacket women'. 
2) optional argument: enter in how many pages of ebay you want it to scrape with
